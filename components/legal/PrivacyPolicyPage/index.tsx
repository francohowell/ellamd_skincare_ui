        <p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Introduction.</b> EllaMD, Inc.
        (“EllaMD”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) provides personalized skin care services,
        including delivery of personalized dermatological products (the “Services”).
        EllaMD operates the website located at https://www.ellamd.com/ and other
        related websites and mobile applications with links (collectively, the
        “Site”) to this Site Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) enabling members
        (“Members”) to use the Services. EllaMD developed this Privacy Policy to
        explain how we collect, use, and disclose information from and/or about you
        when you use the Site or the Services. The Site will be collecting and
        transmitting personal, medical, and other health-related information about
        you. By using the Site and/or the Services, you agree that EllaMD may collect
        and use your personal and other information as described in this Privacy
        Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Site or the Services. If
        you do not understand any aspect of this Privacy Policy, please feel free to
        contact EllaMD by sending an e-mail to
        <a href="mailto:support@ellamd.com">support@ellamd.com</a>. This Privacy Policy is a
        part of EllaMD’s Terms of Use, so by accepting the Terms of Use you are also
        consenting to the use and disclosure of your personal information as outlined
        in this Privacy Policy. EllaMD may change this Privacy Policy at any time.
        You should visit this page periodically to review the Privacy Policy. You
        agree that your continued access and use of this Site will bind you to any
        new terms of the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. By using the Site, you
        are agreeing to our collection, use, and disposal of your Personal
        Information and other data as described in this Privacy Policy, both as it
        exists now and as it is changed from time to time. <b>PLEASE REVIEW THIS
        PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.</b></p>
        <p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Important Definitions.</b></p>
        <p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When we use the term “Personal
        Information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information about you that is
        personally identifiable to you, such as your contact information (e.g., name,
        mailing address, e-mail address, or telephone number), personally
        identifiable health or medical information (“Health Information”), and any
        other non-public information that is associated with such information
        (collectively, “Personal Information”).</p>
        <p>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When we use the term
        “De-Identified Information”, we mean information that is neither used nor
        intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and for which there
        is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to
        identify an individual.</p>
        <p>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When we use the term “Cookies”, we
        mean the small pieces of information that a Site sends to your browser while
        you are viewing a website. When you visit that website again, the Cookie
        allows the website to recognize your web browser. Cookies may store unique
        identifiers, user preferences, and other information.</p>
        <p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Questions.</b> If you have
        questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by sending
        an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@ellamd.com">support@ellamd.com</a>.</p>
        <p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>HIPAA.</b> Our privacy
        practices are intended to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and
        Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA“). We will maintain the privacy of your
        Protected Health Information (“PHI”) as required by HIPAA and the regulations
        promulgated thereunder. We encourage you to review our Notice of Privacy
        Practices, which may be found at
        <span>https://my.ellamd.com/privacy-practices</span> and which describe how
        we may use and disclose your Health Information.</p>
        <p>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Other Applicable Law.</b>
        California residents have special protections under state law regarding the
        access and use of Personal Information. <i>See</i> <span>Cal. Civil
        Code</span> §§ 1798.80 to .84.</p>
        <p>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Individuals Under Age 18.</b>
        This Site is not directed to children and children are not eligible to use
        our Services. We will not knowingly collect information from Site users under

        use the Site or any of our Services or provide any Personal Information about
        yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from
        a child under 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>

        <p>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Health information about you

        <p>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Other information that you

        <p>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> EllaMD may use your Personal
        Information for the following purposes (subject to applicable legal
        restrictions):</p>
        <p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To provide you with the Services
        and customer support (e.g., administer your account, process your payments,
        fulfill your orders);</p>

        <p>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To market and promote the
        Site and the Services to you (you can “opt out” of receiving direct marketing
        and/or market research inquiries by e-mailing us at
        <a href="mailto:support@ellamd.com">support@ellamd.com</a>. Please note that even if
        you opt-out, we may still send you certain Site and Services related
        communications.);</p>
        <p>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To fulfill any other purpose for
        which you provide us Personal Information; and</p>
        <p>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> For any other purpose for which
        you give us authorization.</p>
        <p>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> EllaMD also may disclose your
        Personal Information that we collect or that you provide (subject to
        applicable legal restrictions):</p>
        <p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To our subsidiaries and
        affiliates;</p>
        <p>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To contractors, service providers,
        and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by
        contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and to use
        it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them;</p>
        <p>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To third parties to whom you ask
        us to send such information. If applicable, any disclosures to your health
        plan will be in strict compliance with the limitations imposed on disclosures
        of PHI to group health plans under HIPAA.</p>
        <p>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As required or permitted by law,
        which can include providing information as required by a regulation,
        subpoena, court order, legal process, or government inquiry;</p>
        <p>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When we believe in good faith that
        disclosure is necessary to protect your safety or the safety of others, to
        protect our rights, to investigate fraud, or to respond to a government
        request;</p>
        <p>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To a buyer or other
        successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring,
        reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of
        EllaMD’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy,
        liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information maintained
        by the Site is among the assets transferred; and</p>
        <p>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> For any other purpose disclosed by
        us when you provide the Personal Information.</p>
        <p>10.<span>&nbsp;</span> We will not sell or lease your Personal Information
        to any third party.</p>
        <p>11.<span>&nbsp;</span> <b>Information We Collect via Technology.</b> As
        you use the Site or the Services, certain information may be passively
        collected by Cookies, navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators
        (“URLs”) and third party tracking services, including:</p>
        <p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Site Activity Information.</b>
        We may keep track of some of the actions you take on the Site, such as the
        content of searches you perform on the Site.</p>
        <p>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Access Device and Browser
        Information.</b> When you access the Site from a computer or other device, we
        may collect anonymous information from that device, such as your Internet
        protocol address, browser type, connection speed and access times
        (collectively, “Anonymous Information”).</p>
        <p>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Cookies.</b> We may use both
        session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent
        Cookies to make the Site and Service easier to use, to make our advertising
        better, and to protect both you and EllaMD. You can instruct your browser, by
        changing its options, to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt you before
        accepting a Cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept Cookies,
        however, you will not be able to stay logged in to the Site.</p>
        <p>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Do Not Track (“DNT”)
        Signals.</b> California law requires this Privacy Policy to address how
        EllaMD responds to any DNT signal delivered by your browser. <span>You may
        set your browser to refuse these data collection methods, but our Site may
        not recognize or respond to DNT technologies employed by your
        browser.</span></p>
        <p>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Web Beacons</b>. We may also
        occasionally use &quot;web beacons&quot; (also known as &quot;clear
        gifs,&quot; &quot;web bugs,&quot; &quot;1-pixel gifs,&quot; etc.) that allow
        us to collect non Personal Information about your response to our email
        communications, and for other purposes. Web beacons are tiny images, placed
        on a web page or e-mail that can tell us if you have visited a particular
        area of the Site. For example, if you have given us permission to send you
        emails, we may send you an email urging you to use a certain feature of the
        Site. If you do respond to that email and use that feature, the web beacon
        will tell us that our email communication with you has been successful.
        Because web beacons are used in conjunction with persistent cookies
        (described above), if you set your browser to decline or deactivate cookies,
        web beacons cannot function.</p>
        <p>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Real-Time Location.</b>
        Certain features of the Site use GPS technology to collect real-time
        information about the location of your device so that the Site can connect
        you to a health care provider who is licensed or authorized to provide
        services in the state where you are located.</p>
        <p>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Mobile Services.</b> We may
        also collect non-Personal Information from your mobile device or computer.
        This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant
        information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used
        include how you use the application(s) and information about the type of
        device or computer you use. In addition, in the event our application(s)
        crashes on your mobile device we will receive information about your mobile
        device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify
        and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our application(s).</p>
        <p>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>Google Analytics.</b> We use
        Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics
        uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site,
        what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the
        Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our
        Site and Services. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to
        you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally
        identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie
        on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit
        the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to
        use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to
        the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google
        Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on
        return visits to this Site by disabling cookies on your browser.</p>
        <p>12.<span>&nbsp;</span> <b>De-Identified Information.</b> We may use
        De-Identified Information created by us without restriction.</p>
        <p>13.<span>&nbsp;</span> <b>Information You Share with Third Parties.</b>
        This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Site
        and in email, text and other electronic communications set through or in
        connection with the Site. If you disclose information to others, including,
        for example, a partner providing goods and services, different rules may
        apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.
        <b><i>The use and disclosure restrictions contained in this Privacy Policy
        will not apply to any third party</i></b>. We do not control the privacy
        policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of
        those third parties where applicable. When you click on links on the Site you
        may leave our site. EllaMD is not responsible for the privacy practices of
        other websites, and we encourage you to read their respective site privacy
        policies.</p>
        <p>14.<span>&nbsp;</span> <b>Modification of Information.</b> EllaMD will not
        verify, modify or otherwise alter any Member Personal Information without the
        consent of the applicable Member, however, EllaMD may correct any internal
        errors or modify any immaterial information at any time. Members will be able
        to update some of their information through the Site. Requests to modify any
        information may also be submitted directly to
        <a href="mailto:support@ellamd.com">support@ellamd.com</a>. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>15.<span>&nbsp;</span> <b>Deletion of Information.</b> You may close your
        account online and request deletion of your Personal Information by EllaMD,
        but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this
        information and not to delete it (or to keep this information for a certain
        time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we
        have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete Personal Information, it
        will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives and
        we may also retain anonymous information about your use of our Services. Once
        we disclose some of your Personal Information to third parties, we may not be
        able to access that Personal Information any longer and cannot force the
        deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we
        have made those disclosures. After we delete Personal Information, we will
        retain De-Identified Data and will continue to use De-Identified Data as
        permitted under this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>16.<span>&nbsp;</span> <b>Steps We Take to Keep Your Personal Information
        Secure.</b> EllaMD employs reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial
        security methods to help protect against unauthorized access to Personal
        Information, consistent with applicable law. We provide secure transmission
        of your Personal Information from your PC or mobile device to our servers
        and/or our Site. Personal Information collected by our Site is stored in
        secure operation environments that are not available to the public. Further,
        we use a password and authentication system that is user specific to ensure
        that users can only see the specific information to which they have been
        granted access. We also have policies, procedures, and controls to reduce the
        risk of unauthorized or accidental use, disclosure, or destruction of your
        Personal Information, and we train our employees on data security. Please be
        aware, however, that no data transmission via the Internet or a data storage
        facility is guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while we try to
        protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security
        of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. There
        is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or
        destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial
        safeguards. As with all electronic communications there are potential risks
        such as failures of hardware, software, and/or internet connections. We are
        not responsible for failures, distortions, delays, or other problems
        resulting from equipment configuration, connection, signal power, hardware,
        software, or any equipment used to access the internet. We do not guarantee
        that the confidentiality or security of any electronic transmissions via the
        internet can be assured, due to potentially unsecure computers or links,
        which could result in your information becoming lost or intercepted during
        transmission. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login
        information and to use good judgment before deciding to send information via
        the internet.</p>
        <p>17.<span>&nbsp;</span> <b>Third Party Sites.</b> The Site may contain
        links to other websites. EllaMD does not share your Personal Information with
        those third party sites, unless specifically authorized by you. EllaMD is not
        responsible for the privacy policies and practices of any third party site
        that may be linked to our Site and not wholly owned and controlled by EllaMD,
        its affiliates, and subsidiaries. We aim to work with trusted partners and
        organizations which are bound by the same state and federal laws governing
        information privacy and security; however, we encourage you to be aware when
        you leave our Site and to review any privacy policy of a non-EllaMD
        website.</p>
        <p>18.<span>&nbsp;</span> <b>Report Violations.</b> You should report any
